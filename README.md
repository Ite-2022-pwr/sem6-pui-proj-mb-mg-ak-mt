# Setup
## Docker-compose
Currently in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) we create 2 containers:
```
- moviepicker-backend 
    Django backend exposed on localhost:80000 (currently without https)

- moviepicker-postgres  
    Postgres database with persistent volume (local folder is choosed by docker-compose)
    Exposed on localhost:5432
    So please be aware that your database is not being shared (at least at this moment)
```


To create and run the application run:
`docker-compose up --build`

## Django
When you start Django for the first time (or after database deletion, or after creating new model (doing change in databse)) You need to make migrations to create tables in db.
```
# This will check for any changed to the db and make necessary changes 
docker-compose exec moviepicker-backend python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec moviepicker-backend python manage.py makemigrations
```

To create an admin user (for admin panel)
```
docker-compose exec moviepicker-backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```


## Import example data
In [README.md](backend/README.md) there is a section explaining simple [helper.py](backend/scripts/helper.py) functions to get some data from the TMDB api

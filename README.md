# Setup
## Docker-compose
Currently in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) we create 2 containers:
```
- moviepicker-backend 
    Django backend exposed on localhost:80000 (currently without https)

- moviepicker-postgres  
    Postgres database with persistent volume (local folder is choosed by docker-compose)
    Exposed on localhost:5432
    So please be aware that your database is not being shared (at least at this moment)
```


To create and run the application run:
`docker-compose up --build`

## Import example data
In [README.md](backend/README.md) there is a section explaining simple [helper.py](backend/scripts/helper.py) functions to get some data from the TMDB api
